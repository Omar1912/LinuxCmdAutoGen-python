# Python Command Manual Generator

This project automates the generation of system manuals for Python commands. The script generates structured XML files for various Python commands, including their description, version history, examples, related commands, syntax and usage patterns, and links to online documentation.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create a Python-based tool that reads Python commands from an input file, retrieves detailed information about each command, and outputs the data into structured XML files. Additionally, the tool provides functionality to verify the accuracy of the generated manuals, suggest related commands, and perform search operations.

## Features

### Command Manual Generation
- Generates structured XML manuals for Python commands.
- Each manual contains the following sections:
  - **Command Description**: Detailed information about the command.
  - **Version History**: The version of the command or Python package.
  - **Example**: Examples of how to use the command.
  - **Related Commands**: Commands related to the current command.
  - **Syntax and Usage**: Syntax, including required and optional parameters.
  - **Online Documentation Links**: Links to further resources and official documentation.

### Verification
- Verifies the generated manuals by comparing them with the actual command outputs and descriptions.
- Detects changes in command syntax or behavior and reports them.

### Command Recommendation System
- Suggests related Python commands based on command names and functionalities.
- Provides recommendations after each search.

### Search Functionality
- Allows users to search for specific commands or keywords in the generated manuals.
- Independent search feature that users can access at any time.

## Object-Oriented Design

The project is structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and reusability.

### `CommandManualGenerator` Class
- The main class responsible for reading Python commands from an input file and generating XML manuals for each command.
- Encapsulates the overall process of manual creation and coordination.

### `CommandManual` Class
- Represents an individual manual for a Python command.
- Retrieves information about the command using subprocess calls and formats it into XML.
- Each instance is associated with a single command, ensuring clean management of command information.

## Input

The script reads a list of Python commands from a file (e.g., `commands.txt`). Each line in the input file represents a single Python command that will be documented in the manual.

## XML Output Example

The script generates XML files for each Python command in the following format:

```xml
<Manuals>
    <CommandManual>
        <CommandName>...</CommandName>
        <CommandDescription>...</CommandDescription>
        <VersionHistory>...</VersionHistory>
        <Example>...</Example>
        <RelatedCommands>...</RelatedCommands>
        <SyntaxAndUsage>...</SyntaxAndUsage>
        <DocumentationLinks>...</DocumentationLinks>
    </CommandManual>
</Manuals>
